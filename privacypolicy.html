        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>The Chrome extension that I have developed (Reddit Liberation: Feed Blocker), 
            locally stores the subreddit names the user has put into the options page.
            These subreddit names are solely used for the extension's functionality (blocking, or unblocking web pages).
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension or the developer, does not and cannot share the data (subreddit names) with anybody.
            The developer does not have access to any user data.
        </p>
